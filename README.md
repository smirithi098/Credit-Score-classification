# Classification Model Project

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to develop a classification model to predict the credit rating of companies based on their financial metrics. This project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation.

## Approach
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
   - Load the dataset and perform necessary preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Perform EDA to understand the data distribution, relationships between variables, and to identify any potential data quality issues.
   
3. **Model Implementation**:
   - Implement classification models using algorithms like Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
   - Use cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize the models.
   
4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
